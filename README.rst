Development Workflow ASsistant
==============================

**Flexible developer workflow automation CLI in Python**

``dwas`` takes inspiration from `tox <https://tox.wiki/>`_,
`nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_ and `Invoke <https://www.pyinvoke.org/>`_ and
aims to delivers a middle ground, the builtin isolation of tox, together with
the scriptability of nox and the extensibility of Invoke, mixed with dependency
management and provided common use cases.

If ``dwas`` does not satisfy your use case, maybe one of those will?

⚠️ This project is currently in early development. Contributions and issues are
very welcome but compatibility may be broken at any point.


Getting Started
---------------

`A more detailed documentation <https://dwas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ is
available.


Installation
************

Currently, ``dwas`` is not published on `Pypi <https://pypi.org/>`_ and needs to
be installed from the repository. With pip, you can do the following:

.. code-block:: shell

   # Here PYTHON_VERSION is the version for which you want to install ``dwas``.
   # Remember that it needs at least python3.9. In a virtual environment, using
   # `python` should be enough.
   python${PYTHON_VERSION} -m pip install git+https://github.com/BenjaminSchubert/dwas.git@main

For more information and explanation, please see
`our docs <https://dwas.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__


Running dwas
************

Once installed, you can run ``dwas`` on any project with a ``dwasfile.py`` in
it.

For example, to run all default steps:

.. code-block:: shell

   dwas

Or, to list all the steps available:

.. code-block:: shell

   dwas --list
