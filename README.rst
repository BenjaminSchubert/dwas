Development Workflow ASsistant
==============================

**Flexible developer workflow automation CLI in Python**

``dwas`` takes inspiration from `tox <https://tox.wiki/>`_,
`nox <https://nox.thea.codes/>`_ and `Invoke <https://www.pyinvoke.org/>`_ and
aims to delivers a middle ground, the builtin isolation of tox, together with
the scriptability of nox and the extensibility of Invoke, mixed with dependency
management and provided common use cases.

If ``dwas`` does not satisfy your use case, maybe one of those will?

⚠️ This project is currently in early development. Contributions and issues are
very welcome but compatibility may be broken at any point.
