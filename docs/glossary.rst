    artifact
        An artifact is a piece of data generated by a step that other steps can
        consumer.

    step
        A step represent an action or an intention that needs to happen as part
        of a pipeline. This is similar to a tox ``environment``, a nox
        ``session``, or a make ``target``.

        Examples of steps could be ``build``, ``lint``, ``format``.

    step group
        A step that does nothing by itself but acts as a proxy for multiple
        steps.

        Examples could be a ``pytest`` step, that depends on ``pytest[3.9]``
        and ``pytest[3.10]``.
